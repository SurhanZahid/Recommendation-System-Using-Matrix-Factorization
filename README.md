<h1>Recommendation System Using Matrix Factorization</h1>
<p>In this project we make a movie recommender using matrix factorization in python.The tools that are used in this project are as 
follows.</p>
<ol>
<li>Numpy</li>
<li>Pandas</li>
</ol>
<p>The dataset i have used is MovieLens dataset which is one of the most common datasets used when implementing and testing recommender engines.I have used the small dataset for this program you can check the website for the larger dataset <a target="_blank" href="https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/">here</a>.To downlaod the exact dataset i have used then just click <a target="_blank" href="http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-latest-small.zip">here</a></p>
<h2>Matrix Factorization</h2>
<p>A matrix factorization is simply a mathematical tool for playing around with matrices and is therefore applicable in many scenarios where one would like to find out something hidden under the data.</p>
